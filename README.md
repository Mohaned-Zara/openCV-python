# OpenCV-Python Learning Journey 🚀

Welcome to my personal repository for learning and experimenting with **OpenCV using Python**.  
This repo contains code snippets, mini-projects, and notes that document my progress as I explore the powerful world of **Computer Vision**.
## 📚 What You'll Find Here

- 📸 Basics of OpenCV (image loading, displaying, saving)
- 🖼️ Image processing techniques (filters, blurring, thresholding)
- 🎨 Color spaces and transformations
- 🔍 Feature detection (edges, corners, contours)
- 🧠 Object detection and tracking
- 🧪 Experiments and practice tasks

## 🛠️ Technologies Used

- Python 3.x
- OpenCV (cv2)
- NumPy
- Jupyter Notebooks (for some interactive demos)

## 🚧 Work In Progress

This repository is constantly being updated as I continue learning. Feel free to explore the files, try the code, and share suggestions or improvements.
